        | This site contains a set of references and quizzes for Latin vocabulary
        | based on data from <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org'>Wiktionary</a>.

        | in Wiktionary itself or, more likely, bugs in my attempts to parse it.
      p
        | The quizzes on this site can be calibrated so that more common Latin words
        | appear more frequently.  The settings can be adjusted using the drop-down
        | menu at the top right of the page.  Currently, most of the available
        | settings are based on the frequency with which words appear in the
        | <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid'>Aeneid</a>.  Lower levels
        | are geared towards beginners; higher levels are more likely to present
        | rare words.
